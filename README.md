# Yew web app for Rust using Tailwind + DaisyUI
* [Yew](https://yew.rs/): A Rust framework for creating webapps in WebAssembly
* [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/): A CSS UI framework akin to Twitter's Bootstrap
* [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/): A layer on top of Tailwind that provides common components

This project integrates a bunch of popular frameworks and tools to provide an example for quickly creating a web UI using Rust.

## Getting Started
First, install the prereqs (this assumes you have npm and Cargo already installed):
```
# Install NPM deps (tailwind, daisyui)
npm install
# Install trunk-rs
cargo install --locked trunk
```

And then start it up:
```
trunk serve --open
```

Bam, nice and easy.
